## Description
  This project was made by me to show some easy ways to build Django Web applications. I used Django RestFramework with React JS to the frontend. You can clone this project as a playground and modify some code.
  I have to finish some changes and deploy it. Here are some tips to run this Web application.

  ## Run the project
  First, i didn't use the pyvenv, but i'll implement ih this project. 
  You have to install python3 >=. First, do:

  ```
pip3 install --upgrade pip
```

After that, install the follows libs:
```
pip3 install django djangorestframework django-cors-headers
```

Now, in the root path of the project, run: 
```
python3 manage.py runserver
```
This will make the backend run in the localhost:8000. <br>
Now, go to the my-blog-front directory and install the npm and vite, if you dont have it:
